## 🚀 About Me  

I am a **Senior Cloud & Platform Engineer** with nearly **10 years of experience** designing, building, and operating **secure, scalable, and cost-efficient cloud platforms** on AWS.

My background spans **infrastructure architecture**, **platform engineering**, **Infrastructure as Code**, **CI/CD automation**, **data ingestion pipelines**, **logging and observability platforms**, and **cloud security & governance**.  

Recently, I have been focusing on **AWS cost optimisation and FinOps-aligned engineering**, building systems that bridge the gap between **cloud usage, architectural decisions, and business cost ownership**.

I enjoy solving real engineering problems, simplifying complex systems, and building platforms that scale responsibly.

## 🏗 Featured Projects  

### 🔸 AWS Cost Optimisation & FinOps Insight Platform (MVP)

A cloud-native **AWS cost optimisation platform** focused on bridging the gap between **infrastructure usage, architectural context, and business cost visibility**.

**What this project demonstrates:**
- Practical FinOps-aligned engineering rather than reactive cost cutting  
- Architecture-aware cost insights instead of isolated billing reports  
- Ownership of cost as a first-class platform concern  

**Key capabilities:**
- Ingests AWS billing and usage data alongside infrastructure metadata  
- Correlates services, workloads, and environments to surface **actionable optimisation opportunities**  
- Identifies inefficiencies across compute, storage, and managed services  
- Designed to support collaboration between **engineering and finance teams**  

**Architecture & tooling:**
- AWS billing and cost data ingestion  
- Serverless and container-based processing using Lambda and ECS Fargate  
- Data analysis using DynamoDB, RDS, and OpenSearch  
- Infrastructure defined using Terraform  

**Focus areas:**
- Cost attribution and visibility  
- Architecture-driven optimisation recommendations  
- Scalable design suitable for multi-account AWS environments

### 🔸 Terraform AWS Enterprise Boilerplate

An **enterprise-grade AWS reference architecture** built using Terraform, designed for **secure, scalable, and compliant multi-environment deployments**.

This project demonstrates how to build a **production-ready cloud foundation** using modular Infrastructure as Code principles.

**Key features:**
- Modular Terraform architecture for network, IAM, logging, and compute  
- Environment isolation for `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`  
- Security-first design with least-privilege IAM and encryption by default  
- Centralised logging using S3, CloudWatch, and KMS  
- CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions for Terraform validation and deployment  

**Use cases:**
- AWS landing zones  
- Platform engineering foundations  
- Enterprise and regulated workloads  
- Scalable infrastructure automation patterns

### 🔸 AWS Data Pipeline: JSON → Parquet → Analytics

A production-style data ingestion and analytics pipeline demonstrating **real-world cloud data engineering patterns**.

**Highlights:**
- High-volume log ingestion  
- JSON to Parquet transformations  
- Storage and indexing across DynamoDB, RDS, and OpenSearch  
- Serverless and container-based ETL workflows
